According to documentation at https://www.vultr.com/api/ API requests are limited to an average of 2/s.
when you create api as:
    $vultrApi = new Vultr("key");
default rate limit is 2 req/s.

If you absolutely sure that you need other rate limit (may be you have privileged access to api) - you can change it:
    $vultrApi = new Vultr("key", 5); // set limit rate to 5 req/sec

but if the server does not agree with this - you get 503 error on some queries.
